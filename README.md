# README: DRIVE Program at TU/e

## About the DRIVE Program
**The TU/e DRIVE program fosters innovation in education through the use of educational technology (EdTech). DRIVE supports and empowers educators to improve the quality of education through the development and integration of digital tools and approaches within their classrooms.**<br><br>
DRIVE stands for Digital, Resilience, Innovation, Visionary, and Empower. These five principles underpin the program's mission: to embrace digital solutions, foster adaptive and resilient learning environments, stimulate educational innovation, develop visionary educational practices, and empower students as active participants in their own learning.<br><br>
The DRIVE program continues BOOST!'s successful teacher-driven innovation approach. Based on the [Vision on Education](https://assets.w3.tue.nl/w/fileadmin/content/pers/2023/09%20September/CBL%20serie/CBL%20algemeen/9044%20TUE%20TUeVisionOnEducation_DIGITAL_MR.pdf), [results of the BOOST! program](https://boost.tue.nl/projects/) and (technological) developments in higher education and the world, the DRIVE program focuses on five topics:
1.	**AI in education:** Education for, with, and despite AI.
2.	**E-assessment:** Innovative assessment options using technology. Including assessment of competence and skill development, and a focus on challenge-based learning, collaborative learning and (peer)feedback.
3.	**Learning Analytics:** Use of data with the purpose of understanding and optimizing learning and teaching
4.	**Modularization:** Accessibility of (modularized) educational resources for students and teachers beyond the course level
5.	**Virtualization:** Learning and teaching of knowledge and/or skills that are not possible with current (on-campus) resources. Including XR, VR, innovative lab education and gamification.
> This program is aimed at realizing TU/e’s Vision on Education towards (1) learning in a flexible hybrid system to facilitate diverse learning paths, (2) an authentic, integrative, and activating educational concept: Challenge Based Learning, and (3) self-directed learning that acknowledges personal development and professional identity.

## The Four Routes of DRIVE
DRIVE consists of four interconnected routes which together support the achievement of the TU/e Vision on Education.
* **Route I – Educator-Driven Innovation (BOOST! 2.0):**
Building on the success from BOOST!, DRIVE Route 1 is open to TU/e educators who wish to experiment with innovative approaches to teaching and learning using digital technologies. The program offers a structured opportunity to apply for funding and support to run pilot projects within the aforementioned five topics. For more information please visit our [Call for Proposals webpage](https://boost.tue.nl/call-for-proposals/).
* **Route II – Vision-Driven Development:**
This route initiates pilots that are necessary to realize TU/e’s educational vision but are less likely to arise through Route I. Route II focuses on building a flexible and sustainable EdTech landscape by prioritizing strategic developments on the five topics at an institutional level. Each topic is managed by a Topic Driver and a co-Driver who work together with a multidisciplinary team to initiate pilots within their topic based on input from educators and students. Together with [ALT](https://www.tue.nl/en/academy-for-learning-and-teaching) we are setting up learning communities around these topic to further strengthen our efforts within each topic.
* **Route III – Scaling up High-Potential Pilots:**
Education innovation pilots are mostly initiated and executed within a specific context of one or a few courses. All of these pilot have added value for the quality of education in that context. However, some pilots may also have potential beyond that, for other courses, departments or educational institutions. This route is dedicated to identifying high-potential pilots from BOOST! and DRIVE and supporting their transition from pilot to implementation within TU/e and beyond.
* **Route IV – Organizational Learning:**
Educational innovation requires an adaptive and forward-thinking organization. This route focuses on monitoring and stimulating the university’s development into an innovation-ready institution. It strengthens the university’s capacity to adapt to changes by improving internal processes, aligning policies, and connecting with national programs like Npuls. This route makes the organization more agile, so it can better support the ongoing implementation and sustainability of educational innovations.
