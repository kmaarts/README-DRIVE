# README: DRIVE Program at TU/e

## About the DRIVE Program
The DRIVE program is an initiative by Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) focused on fostering innovation in education through the use of educational technology (EdTech). It is designed to support and empower educators in improving the quality of education through the development and integration of digital tools and approaches within their classrooms.
DRIVE stands for Digital, Resilience, Innovation, Visionary, and Empower. These five principles underpin the program's mission: to embrace digital solutions, foster adaptive and resilient learning environments, stimulate educational innovation, develop visionary educational practices, and empower students as active participants in their own learning.
The DRIVE program continuous BOOST!'s successful teacher-driven innovation approach. Based on the Vision on Education, results of the BOOST! program and (technological) developments in higher education and the world, the DRIVE program focuses on five topics:
1.	AI in education: Education for, with and despite AI.
2.	E-assessment: Innovative assessment options using technology. Including assessment of competence and skill development, and a focus on challenge-based learning, collaborative learning and (peer)feedback.
3.	Learning Analytics: Use of data with the purpose of understanding and optimizing learning and teaching
4.	Modularization: Accessibility of (modularized) educational resources for students and teachers beyond the course level
5.	Virtualization: Learning and teaching of knowledge and/or skills that are not possible with current (on-campus) resources. Including XR, VR, innovative lab education and gamification.
This program is aimed at realizing TU/e’s Vision on Education towards (1) learning in a flexible hybrid system to facilitate diverse learning paths, (2) an authentic, integrative, and activating educational concept: Challenge Based Learning, and (3) self-directed learning that acknowledges personal development and professional identity.

## For Educators: Submit Your Proposal
DRIVE is open to TU/e educators who wish to experiment with innovative approaches to teaching and learning using digital technologies. The program offers a structured opportunity to apply for funding and support to run pilot projects within the aforementioned five topics.
Each year, there are two moments to submit proposals for new pilot projects. These projects fall under Route I of the DRIVE program, which continues the bottom-up, educator-driven approach that made BOOST! a success. Proposals should address one or more of the program’s core themes and demonstrate potential to enhance student learning.


> Educators are encouraged to experiment, co-develop solutions in collaboration with students, and contribute to a growing body of innovative educational practices at TU/e. Selected proposals receive funding, access to support services, and opportunities for collaboration with experts from the university’s educational and IT services.


## The Four Routes of DRIVE
DRIVE consists of four interconnected routes which together help achieve the vision on education of the TU/e.
* **Route I – Educator-Driven Innovation (BOOST! 2.0):**
This route supports pilot projects initiated by educators. Proposals should address themes such as Artificial Intelligence in education, Learning Analytics, XR/VR, Modularization, and E-assessment. The aim is to enable hands-on experimentation and co-creation of educational innovations, just like BOOST!.
* **Route II – Vision-Driven Development:**
This route initiates projects that are necessary to realize TU/e’s educational vision but are less likely to arise through individual educator initiatives alone. Route II focuses on building a flexible and sustainable EdTech landscape by prioritizing strategic developments at a program-wide level.
* **Route III – Scaling up High-Potential Pilots:**
Successful pilots often remain isolated. This route is dedicated to identifying high-potential projects from BOOST! and DRIVE and supporting their transition from pilot to implementation within education and beyond. 
* **Route IV – Organizational Learning:**
Educational innovation requires an adaptive and forward-thinking organization. This route focuses on strengthening TU/e’s capacity for innovation through professional development, improved governance, and policy development related to EdTech.

## How to Get Involved
Educators can submit their proposals twice a year. Each call includes clear guidelines, evaluation criteria, and support in preparing proposals. All projects must align with the TU/e Vision on Education and demonstrate how they contribute to enhancing the learning experience through digital technology.

To apply for funding or learn more about the program, you can download the proposal template and submission guidelines through Call for Proposals.
